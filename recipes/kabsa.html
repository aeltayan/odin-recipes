    <p>
        Kabsa is a vibrant and aromatic rice dish commonly enjoyed across the Arabian Peninsula, particularly in Saudi Arabia.
        It's known for its rich blend of spices and diverse ingredients, making it a hearty and flavorful meal. 
        Typically, Kabsa features basmati rice cooked with a fragrant mix of spices such as saffron, cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon.
        The dish often includes a protein element, like chicken, lamb, or beef, which is braised or roasted and then mixed with the rice.
        Vegetables like tomatoes, carrots, and bell peppers can also be added for extra flavor and texture.

        Kabsa is garnished with fried onions, raisins, and nuts like almonds or cashews, adding a delightful crunch and a hint of sweetness.
        The dish is usually served with a side of salad or yogurt, enhancing its flavor profile. The combination of spices, tender meat, 
        and perfectly cooked rice creates a dish that’s both comforting and indulgent, making Kabsa a beloved staple in Middle Eastern cuisine.
